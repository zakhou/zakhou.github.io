<p>I am currently a postdoctoral astrophysicist at the University of Chicago, transitioning to data science. Having
been working with data from telescopes and satellites, I have developed skills for data processing, predictive modeling,
and data visualization.</p>

<p>At UChicago, I work with the collaboration of 
<a href="https://pole.uchicago.edu/" style="color:rgb(2,70,148);text-decoration:none;">South Pole Telescope (SPT)</a>, focusing on the cross-validation of data between
SPT and other observations. I also work on the numerical simulation engine used across multiple teams within the 
collaboration, making sure the communications with teams are accurate and effective and the simulation products meet 
diverse analysis requirements.</p>

<p>Before moving to Chicago, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Davis, working with both
<a href="http://planck.caltech.edu/index.html" style="color:rgb(2,70,148);text-decoration:none;">Planck</a> and SPT
collaborations. My job was to do model training for Planck optical system calibration and the predictive modeling of the
evolution of the Universe using Planck and SPT data. From 09/2013 to 06/2014, I was visiting NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
to
