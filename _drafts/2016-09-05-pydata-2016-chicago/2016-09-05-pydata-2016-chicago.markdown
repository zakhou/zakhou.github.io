Last weekend I was excited to join PyData Chicago 2016 conference, hosted at the student center in The University of Illinois at Chicago. According to the [main page](http://pydata.org/chicago2016/) of this event, "PyData conferences bring together users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The PyData community gathers to discuss how best to apply Python tools, as well as tools using R and Julia, to meet evolving challenges in data management, processing, analytics, and visualization." This was exactly what I had expected before joining the meeting. As an astrophysicist using Python, I focused on analyzing the data from satellites and telescopes, maybe too much in last several years without realizing the development of the Python community in data science.

The conference was consist of one day of tutorial sessions and two days of general sessions.
