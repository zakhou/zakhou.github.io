Last weekend I was excited to join PyData Chicago 2016 conference, hosted at the 
student center in The University of Illinois at Chicago. According to the 
[main page](http://pydata.org/chicago2016/) of this event, "PyData conferences 
bring together users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and 
learn from each other. The PyData community gathers to discuss how best to apply 
Python tools, as well as tools using R and Julia, to meet evolving challenges in 
data management, processing, analytics, and visualization." This was exactly what I had expected before joining the meeting. 

As an astrophysicist using Python, I
focused on analyzing the data from satellites and telescopes, maybe too much in 
a long history without realizing the booming development of data science community
with the technology of machine learning, predictive modeling, and data 
visualization. This conference gave me a great opportunity to know people in data
science, especially in Chicago area, and start getting involved in this community.


## Tutorial Sessions

The conference was consist of one day of tutorial sessions and two days of 
general sessions. In Friday morning, I attended the first tutorial 
["Pandas: .head() to .tail()"](http://pydata.org/chicago2016/schedule/presentation/32/) 
lead by Tom Augspurger. I started using Pandas from Kaggle competitions.
